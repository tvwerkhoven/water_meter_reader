# Water meter reader. Max update rate of domoticz over JSON is Â±1Hz, or 60 
# liter per minute (1 update per revolution), sufficient for our purposes. 
# My tap runs at 7.5 liter/minute
#
# Todo:
# 1. Check what happens if updates are faster than json calls (do these 
#    queue or not?) --> JSON calls are quite fast (<<second), probably not a problem
# 2. Add scheduler that does a NOOP every hour if there is no new data (to 
#    fill the graph) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23512970/how-to-implement-multiple-signals-in-a-program
#
#
# Known risks:
# 1. The sensor might falsely trigger when the rotating disk ends exactly in 
#   the middle of the edge between high and low contrast, causing the sensor
#   to give a voltage exactly around the threshold voltage. This is 
#   partially mitigated by having a minimum delay time, but this does not
#   solve it. Problem does not seem very severe
